# About

This software provides a collection of utilities for analyzing social media data (in JSON format) from Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. It is designed to be used either standalone (as most classes provide a `main` function for running directly via `spark-submit`) or integrated into another package or Jupyter notebook.

# Building

You can build this package with maven trivially using the following command: 

    mvn package

# Documentation

I'll provide documentation in the near term
